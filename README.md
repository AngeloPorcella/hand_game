# Overview

A simple game created using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
This is an AR game similar to what you would find on the XBOX Kinect.
Hand tracking via the MP library allows you to "hit" randomly spawned shapes using your webcam.
After 10 have been hit, you win!
Watch out, each shape can de-spawn after a set period.


# Setup

Requires OpenCV, and MediaPipe.

Run the commands:
```
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe
pip install numpy
```
