# Overview

A simple game created using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
This is an AR game similar to what you would find on the XBOX Kinect.
Hand tracking via the MP library allows you to "hit" randomly spawned shapes using your webcam.
After 10 have been hit, you win!
Watch out, each shape can de-spawn after a set period.

Following my father's stroke i'm pivoting this project to stroke recovery. I'm working on a gesture based game that can track his progress in restoring functionality to his affected hand.


# Setup

Requires Numpy, OpenCV, and MediaPipe

Run the commands:
```
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe
pip install numpy
```
